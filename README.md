# CSS calc() function unexpected behavior
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the CSS `calc()` function.  The `calc()` function requires spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /) to function correctly.  Failure to do so can lead to unexpected results or the CSS being ignored entirely.  The `bug.css` file shows the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.css` provides the correct implementation.
